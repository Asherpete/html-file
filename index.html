            We’ve come a long way from the very first computer and even the
            first smartphone. But how much do you really know about their
            history and evolution? From floppy discs to artificial intelligence
            (AI) software, the Acorn to the Macintosh, let’s explore how far
            we’ve come.

            While today we use computers for both work and play, they were
            actually created for an entirely different purpose.

            In 1880, the population of the United States had grown so large that
            it took seven years to formulate the results of the U.S. Census. So,
            the government looked for a faster way to get the job done, which is
            why punch-card computers were invented, which took up an entire
            room. The first digital computer, known as the Pascal Machine, has
            its roots in the 16th century. The Pascal Machine was the first
            revelation in the world of computers before Charles Babbage invented
            the Difference engine. From assembly to binary, we have come a long
            way.

            While that’s how the story starts, it’s certainly not where it ends.
            Let’s explore the history of computers.

          <h1>Computers in the 1600s</h1>

          <p>
            In the 1600s, the idea of an analog computer became a little known.
            A computer was referred to a device that is for mathematical and
            statistical calculations. It used the techniques of decimal,
            statistics and logarithmic expressions to compute values. Women were
            tasked with such calculations and computations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1617:</b> John Napier invented Napier Bones, a manual calculating
            apparatus. Napier bones was a handheld device that used to support
            multiplication and division. It was also known as Napier Rods.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1642::</b> Biase Pascal, a french mathematician invented
            Pascaline, which is also known as the world's first automated
            calculator.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1673: :</b>1673: Gottfried Willhelm Liebniz invented Stepped
            Reckoner or Liebniz wheel, which was an improved version of
            Pascaline. This mechanical calculator could do basic calculations
            and was made of flat drums.

            <b>1801:</b> In France, weaver and merchant Joseph Marie Jacquard
            create a loom that uses wooden punch cards to automate the design of
            woven fabrics. Early computers would use similar punch cards.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>1822:</b> Thanks to funding from the English government,
            mathematician Charles Babbage invented a steam-driven calculating
            machine that was able to compute tables of numbers.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>1822:</b> Charles Babbage invented the difference engine as a
            machine that could perform any kind of calculation, from basic
            mathematical to astronomical calculations.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>1840:</b> Lady Ada Lovelace wrote her first computer programme
            which was a sequence of user-generated instructions for the
            computer.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>1890:</b> Inventor Herman Hollerith designs the punch card system
            to calculate the 1880 U.S. census. It took him three years to
            create, and it saved the government $5 million. He would eventually
            go on to establish a company that would become IBM.

            <b>1936:</b>Alan Turing developed an idea for a universal machine,
            which he would call the Turing machine, that would be able to
            compute anything that is computable. The concept of modern computers
            was based on his idea.
          </p>

            <b>1939:</b> Bill Hewlett and David Packard found Hewlett-Packard in
            a garage in Palo Alto, California. Their first project, the HP 200A
            Audio Oscillator, would rapidly become a popular piece of test
            equipment for engineers.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, Walt Disney Pictures would order eight to test recording
            equipment and speaker systems for 12 specially equipped theaters
            that showed Fantasia in 1940.
